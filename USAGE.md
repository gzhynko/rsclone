This clone implements the space jump (warp, travel, etc.) mechanic from [Starbound](https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/Starbound/).

## Controls
Controls in this game are pretty straightforward:
| Action | Key |
|---|---|
| Walk (run) left | ```A```  |
| Walk (run) right | ```D``` |
| Jump (when the jump modal is open) | ```E``` |

## Features
- **Character control.** Control the human race character with your keyboard. See the control keys above.
- **Ship free roam.** Walk around the human race ship freely.
- **Space warp.** The main feature of this clone. To engage, walk right from the spawn point until you reach the captain's chair. A 'jump modal' will appear afterwards. Press 'E' to jump!

## Credits
All assets are taken straight from Starbound and belong to their respective owners.  

Made for the [RS School](https://rs.school/js/) Clone Wars in 2021.
